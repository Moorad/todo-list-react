## Todo-List-React

This is a simple web application that I made using ReactJS.
It is a very simple website but I'm planning to add a lot of features.

## Backend

I have written the Front-end, that is React, and the backend. I used nodeJS to write the backend
and I will be releasing the backend soon when I get the database fully working and the web app is
more complete.

## Running

For now all ou have to do is clone this repo by putting this command in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/mooradal/todo-list-react.git`

Then you only need to run this:
`npm start`

and the web app should be working.

## Note

This project is not complete and still under development so many bugs and visual issues are not fixed yet
